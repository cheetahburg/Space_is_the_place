	    Thank you for downloading Circular Gradients!
    
	    This asset includes a collection of 33 sprites with different types of circular gradients.
	    Each type has three color versions. One that transitions from white to black (name ending with
	    "_opaque"), another one that transitions from white to transparent (name ending with
	    "_transparent_outside"), and a third one that transitions from transparent to white (name
	    ending with "_transparent_inside"). All sprites are 1024x1024 pixels large, and can be resized
	    to the desired size with GM's stretch tool in the sprite editor, or generated with a specified
	    size with the code provided with the asset.
    
	    In the resource tree you will also find resources that are not sprites. These resources
	    were used for generating the sprites. If you want to, you can adjust some parameters and
	    generate new custom gradients. This can be done by going to the create event of object obj_main.
	    Here you'll find several variables that you can set. The first variable, "generation_shader",
	    is set to the shader used for generating the circular gradient. The shader generates the image
	    and afterward it's saved to a PNG image file. You can set this variable to whichever of the
	    shaders from the "Circular Gradients" folder in the shaders section of the resource tree. In the
	    demo you can use the arrow keys to see the different gradients the shaders offer.
    
	    The next two variables are "sf_result_width" and "sf_result_height". These can be set to the
	    desired image size. If the sprites provided with the asset are too small or too large, you can
	    change these variables and generate them again (this will give the highest quality as opposed to
	    stretching the gradient in the sprite editor).
    
	    The next four variables, "inner_color", "inner_alpha", "outer_color", and "outer_alpha", are used
	    to decide what colors the gradient will be in. The inner part of the image gets one color and
	    alpha and transitions into the color and alpha for the outer part of the image. The sprites
	    provided with this asset are sprites with white inner color with inner alpha 1 transitioning
	    to black outer color with outer alpha 1 (for sprites ending in "_opaque"), white inner color
	    and inner alpha 1 transitioning to white outer color with outer alpha 0 (for sprites ending
	    in "_transparent_outside"), and white inner color and inner alpha 0 transitioning to white
	    outer color and outer alpha 1 (for sprites ending in "_transparent_inside").
    
	    After you've set these variables you can run the game, and the gradient will be generated for
	    you and automatically saved to a file. If you're on Windows, this file can be found in the
	    localappdata directory on your computer. You can get to this directory by opening an explorer
	    window, clicking the address bar and type in %localappdata% and press enter. Locate the folder
	    named "Circular_Gradients". All image files are saved to this folder.
    
	    If you have any questions, you can send a mail to asbjorn.lystrup@gmail.com or message me on
	    the GameMaker forum.
